# ML snippets
Some of the code I've put together to do weird/interesting/cool things (mostly at work) with machine learning models for classification problems. Heavily reliant on the pandas and scikit-learn libraries, though it wouldn't be to difficult to rewrite to avoid the need for pandas. The core code is in `ML_snippets.py` and usage examples are shown in `demos.ipynb`
