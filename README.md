# ML snippets
Some of the code I've put together to do weird/interesting/cool things (mostly at work) with machine learning models for classification problems. The core code is in `ML_snippets.py` and usage examples are shown in `demos.ipynb`. This is heavily reliant on the pandas and scikit-learn libraries, though it wouldn't be too difficult to rewrite and avoid the need for pandas. 

`explanations_demo.ipynb` has some preliminary exploration of two methods for generating human-interpretable explanations/justifications of the predictions of a scikit-learn random forest classifier.
